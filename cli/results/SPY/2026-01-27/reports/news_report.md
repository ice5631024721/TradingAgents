Okay, the user is asking for a comprehensive report on the current state of the world relevant for trading and macroeconomics, focusing on SPY (the S&P 500 ETF). The initial attempt to use the get_global_news_openai function resulted in a 404 error. Let me figure out why that happened.

First, the get_global_news_openai function's description says it retrieves macroeconomic news using OpenAI's API. But the error message suggests the endpoint isn't found. Maybe the function isn't correctly implemented or the API isn't accessible. Since the user mentioned tools like EODHD and Finnhub, but those aren't available here, I need to rely on the provided functions.

The alternative is to use get_google_news with a query related to SPY and macroeconomic factors. The user wants a week's worth of data, so setting look_back_days to 7. Let's try that. The query could include terms like "SPY", "S&P 500", "economic trends", "interest rates", "inflation", etc. That might cover both company-specific news and macroeconomic indicators affecting the S&P 500.

I should also check if the parameters for get_google_news are correctly formatted. The required parameters are query and curr_date, with look_back_days optional. So, using curr_date as 2026-01-27 and look_back_days=7. The query should be broad enough to capture relevant news.

If the first attempt with get_global_news failed, maybe the function is not available. So, focusing on get_google_news with a well-crafted query might be the way to go. Then, analyze the results to identify trends, geopolitical events, economic indicators, and company-specific news related to SPY. Finally, structure the findings into a report with a markdown table summarizing key points.
